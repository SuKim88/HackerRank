c++ Solution for HackerRank Problems

I have decided to solve C++ questions from Hackerrank.com.
Hopefully it's going to help me out to get better at coding step by step.


please leave me a comment if there's alternative ways.
Probably a lot more and efficient ways.

BTW, there's no description of questions.
Let me know, if you need description.

Thanks.
